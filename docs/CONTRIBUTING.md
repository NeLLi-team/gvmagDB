# Contributing

Start with the [Repository Guidelines](Repository_Guidelines.md) for coding style, testing expectations, and pull request requirements. Once you have run through those steps, check the topic-specific docs:

- [Database Workflows](Database_Workflows.md)
- [Project Structure](Project_Structure.md)
- [Distribution Workflow](Distribution_Workflow.md)

If you are planning a change that affects data generation or analytics dashboards, open an issue first so the maintainers can align on artifact handling and deployment timelines.***
