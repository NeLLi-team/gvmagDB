# Release Artifacts

Use this directory to track published artifact metadata for each release.

For every tag:
1. Add `<version>.json` with checksums, artifact URIs, and publication dates.
2. Include human-readable notes (breaking schema changes, ingestion snapshots).
3. Keep the directory sorted chronologically to simplify diffs.

Historical files from pre-docs cleanup reside in `legacy/`; migrate useful details here when updating old releases.***
